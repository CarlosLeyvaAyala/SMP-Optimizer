# SMP Optimizer

Changes xml files so collisions are done on a per vertex basis instead of triangles.

This just automagically does what it's recommended in the [FPS smashed by HDT SMP][guide] guide.

# Usage

Drag and drop a folder, a file or a bunch of files and/or folders to the program.

If a folder is dragged, all its sub-folders will be processed.
